This project was developed for MSD, a multinational pharmaceutical company. The app aims to reduce time browsing and consuming articles. Additionally, it serves as a one stop platform to generate slides and answer relevant questions thereafter

## Exciting Features
- No Limit on uploaded research articles
- Retains important graphs and data
- Seamless Slides Generation
- Slide Generated converted to powerpoint slides immediately
- Recent and changing up to date healthcare discroveries displayed as a carousel with summaries and necessary links

## Available Scripts - Server Set up

After making sure the venv is set up to be with python3 in the server directory, you can run:

### `cd server ` 
### `pip install -r requirements.txt ` 
### `flask run ` 

The server shoud now be running. If any modules error encountered, ensure that your venv is correct and pip install the module therefater

## Available Scripts - Running Web App

Open a new terminal and navigate to the project directory.

After making sure the react and js is installed, you can run:

### `npm install` 
### `npm start` 

The web app shoud now be running. If any modules error encountered, ensure that your venv is correct and npm install the module therefater

## Project Demo


Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
